  I like to spend my free Time by following my Hobbies. I'm crazy about foregin
  languages. I want to be a polyglot. I'm currently learning Japanese on my own
  as I get time, after my certification course completed in it. I'm also into
  K-pop and K-dramas so learn Korean by consuming that content. And I always
  brush-up my english whenever I get chance. I also like to Read and make time
  for reading on daily basis. I read self-help books to improve my Personality
  and life, but also read novels to keep balance and exicitement.
